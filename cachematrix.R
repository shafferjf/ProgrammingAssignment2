## These two functions calculate the inverse of a matrix or retrieves it
##  from the cache if it had been calculated previously

## makeCacheMatrix creates a list with four elements which are passed to
##  parent environment to be used by other functions

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## cacheSolve uses the list from makeCacheMatrix to either calculate
##  the inverse of a matrix or retrieve it from the cache if it has 
##  already been calculated

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
